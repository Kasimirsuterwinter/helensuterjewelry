“All idiots,” Gustave Flaubert once said about architects - “they always forget to put in the stairs.” While another man, Friedrich Mielke, noted stair researcher born in 1921, established an Institute for Stair Research in Konstein, Bavaria.

 this essay following the book about his research.
No one can possibly climb a flight of stairs without making contact with one’s foot. Foot and step dependent on each other. The step height/riser and step width/tread of a stair are tied to the person using it. The length of one step in planar ground for an adult is about 76 cm, which is reduced on an inclination to about 63 cm. Francois Blondel (1618-1686) is likely to have been the first to measure the human step and use it as a base for his formula, which is still being used today.
